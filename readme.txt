master branch files will not contain semester specific information. Semester specific information files will be present in its corresponding branches.



Every folder other than the archived folder will have the skeleton files i.e the dates and ta and prof info will be removed.

archived folder will have data to all previous year files. We do not update this folder because we intend to create a branch from every semester. thus, from now onwards we will have access to every semester files in its own branch.
