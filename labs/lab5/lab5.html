<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The goal of this lab assignment is to extend the LC-3b simulator you
wrote in Lab 4 to handle virtual memory. You will augment the existing
LC-3b microarchitecture in order to support virtual to physical
address translation. You will also provide microarchitectural support
for page fault exceptions and change the protection exception from Lab
4 to be based on access mode in the <abbr title="Page Table Entry">PTE</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Specification</h2>

<h3>Virtual memory</h3>

<p>The virtual address space of the LC-3b is divided into pages of
size 512 bytes. The LC-3b virtual address space has 128 pages, while
physical memory has 32 frames. The LC-3b translates virtual addresses to
physical addresses using a one-level translation scheme. Virtual pages 0&ndash;23
comprise the system space. They are mapped directly to frames 0&ndash;23 and are
always resident in physical memory. The system space may be accessed with any
instruction in supervisor mode, but
only with a TRAP instruction in user mode. The remaining virtual pages (24&ndash;127)
comprise the user space and are mapped to frames 24&ndash;31 via a page table
stored in system space.</p>

<p>The page table contains PTEs for <em>both</em> the system
and user space pages. It resides at the beginning of frame 8 of
physical memory. A page table entry (PTE) contains only 9 bits of
information but, for convenience, is represented by a full 16 bit
word. Thus one PTE occupies two memory locations. The
format of each PTE is as follows:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>15</th><th>14</th><th>13</th><th>12</th><th>11</th><th>10</th><th>9</th><th>8</th>
<th>7</th><th>6</th><th>5</th><th>4</th><th>3</th><th>2</th><th>1</th><th>0</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td><td>0</td><td colspan="5"><abbr title="Page Frame Number">PFN</abbr></td><td>0</td>
<td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td><abbr title="Protection bit">P</abbr></td>
<td><abbr title="Valid bit">V</abbr></td><td><abbr title="Modified bit">M</abbr></td>
<td><abbr title="Reference bit">R</abbr></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>If the protection (P) bit is cleared, the page is <dfn>protected</dfn>: it can only be accessed in supervisor mode
or by a TRAP instruction. Otherwise, the page can be accessed in either user or supervisor mode.
The valid (V) bit indicates whether the page is mapped to a frame in physical memory (V&nbsp;=&nbsp;1) or not (V&nbsp;=&nbsp;0).
The modified (M) bit indicates whether the page has been written to since it was brought in (M&nbsp;=&nbsp;1) or not (M&nbsp;=&nbsp;0).
The reference (R) bit is set on every access to the page and cleared every timer interrupt.</p>
<p>Note that the PFN, the modified, and the reference bits are meaningless
if the page is not resident in memory (the valid bit is zero).</p>

<h3><a id="Exceptions">Exceptions</a></h3>
<p>Lab 5 supports four exceptions, listed below in order of priority (highest to lowest):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Exception</th><th>Vector</th><th>Occurs when &hellip;</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Unaligned access</td><td><code>x03</code></td>
<td>a word-sized memory access to an
odd virtual address is attempted</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Protection</td><td><code>x04</code></td>
<td>the machine is in user mode and
a protected page is accessed by any instruction
other than the TRAP instruction</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Page fault</td><td><code>x02</code></td>
<td>the page accessed by a user program is not valid (not in physical
memory)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unknown Opcode</td><td><code>x05</code></td>
<td>the program tries to use an unknown opcode (1010 or 1011)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Note that unlike Lab 4, in Lab 5 the unaligned access exception has a higher
priority than a protection exception.</p>

<p>All three memory exceptions are detected immediately prior to the exception generating
memory access. Therefore, when a control instruction loads the <abbr title="Program Counter">PC</abbr> with an invalid address, the
machine does not initiate the exception until it attempts to fetch from that invalid address.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<h3>Additions to Datapath</h3>
<p>During the execution of instructions, your microcode will
convert virtual addresses to physical addresses and modify
PTEs when necessary.  To make address translation possible, we have
added two registers to the datapath:
Page Table Base Register (PTBR) and Virtual Address Register (VA). The
PTBR points to the first entry of the page table in physical
memory and will be initialized by the shell code to the starting 
address of the page table file you provide as a command line 
parameter to the simulator. To put the PTBR register onto the bus, you should 
assert the GatePTBR signal. The VA register is a temporary register to 
hold the current address being translated. To put the VA register onto the
bus and to write to the VA register from the bus, you should assert
the GateVA and LD.VA control signals, respectively.</p>

<h3>Address Translation</h3>

<p>We will use a simple one-level translation scheme to translate 
virtual addresses to physical addresses. The high 7 bits of the 
virtual address (bits[15:9]) specify the page number, and the low 
9 bits of the virtual address (bits[8:0]) specify the offset within 
the page. All 7 bits of the page number will be used during translation.
Assume that at the beginning of each address translation phase the
virtual address is located in the <abbr title="Memory Address Register">MAR</abbr>,
and if the operation is a write, a source register holds the data to be written.
Address translation consists of the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Save the MAR into the temporary register VA</li>
<li>Load the MAR with the address of the PTE of the page containing the
VA:
<ul>
<li>MAR[15:8] &larr; PTBR[15:8]</li>
<li>MAR[7:0] &larr; LSHF(VA[15:9], 1)</li>
</ul>
i.e., <span class="equation">MAR &larr; PTBR + (2 &times; page_number)</span>. 
</li>
<li>Read the PTE of the page containing the VA into the MDR</li>
<li>Check for a protection exception</li>
<li>Check for a page fault</li>
<li>Set the reference bit of the PTE</li>
<li>If the pending access is a write, set the modified bit of the PTE</li>
<li>Write the PTE back to memory</li>
<li>Load the physical address into the MAR:
<ul>
<li>MAR[13:9] &larr; PFN</li>
<li>MAR[8:0] &larr; VA[8:0]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the operation is a write, load the MDR with the source
register</li>
</ol>

<p>To add support for virtual memory, you first need to determine when
you need to perform address translation. Then, you will need to
determine how to add an address traslation state sequence to the state
diagram. You will also need to determine how to return back to the
correct state once address translation is complete. For this, you will
need to augment the microsequencer. You are free to add new control
signals, gates, muxes, temporary registers as you wish as long as you
fully document your changes.</p>

<h2>Shell Code</h2>

<p>A modified shell code has been written for
you: <tt><a href="lc3bsim5.c" title="Lab Assignment 5 shell code">lc3bsim5.c</a></tt></p>

<p>You will need to copy and paste the code you wrote for Lab 4
into this new shell code. The shell code takes a new command line parameter that specifies the
file containg the page table to be loaded into physical memory. To run the simulator, type:</p>

<kbd>lc3bsim5 &lt;micro_code_file&gt; &lt;page table
file&gt; &lt;program_file_1&gt; &lt;program_file_2&gt; ...</kbd>

<p>The first parameter is the microcode file as before. The second
parameter is the page table in LC-3b machine language. Note that since
the page table is in physical memory, the first line of this file
should be a physical address. For all the program files (including
the interrupt and exception handlers), which are in virtual memory, the
first line should be a virtual address.</p>

<h2>Writing Code</h2>

<p>You will modify your source code and control store from Lab 4 to implement the specification above. Do not remove Lab 4 functionality, even if it's not mentioned in the specification (for example, the timer interrupt). You will also create the following files to construct a particular execution scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Page table (starting at physical address <code>x1000</code>). The page table will be initialized upon simulator start-up based on the 
contents of the page table file you provided as a command line parameter to 
the simulator. Map pages 0&ndash;23 (system space) to frames 0&ndash;23
and mark them as valid and protected. Map pages 24, 96, and 126 (the user stack) to frames 25, 28, and 29, respectively, and mark them as valid
and unprotected. Mark all other pages as invalid. All invalid PTEs for pages in user space must be marked as
unprotected. Why?</p>

<h2>Things To Consider</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The supervisor stack should start at address <code>x2FFF</code>
(SSP is initialized in the shell code to <code>x3000</code>). If the user program uses the
user stack, the user stack should start at address <code>xFDFF</code> (i.e. the
user program should initialize R6 to <code>xFE00</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When do you need to do address translation? How will you return
from the address translation to the correct state?  An obvious
solution would be to have a register which holds the 6-bit return
address. Although this is acceptable, think about the possibility of
other solutions, e.g. a mechanism that is similar to COND bits in the
microsequencer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since the page table is in physical memory, and the PTBR contains a
physical address, the interrupt service routine needs to access the
PTEs using physical addresses. An easy way to do this is to turn off
virtual to physical address translation when operating in system mode.
This will have the added benefit of reducing the number of cycles
taken to execute the ISR. What restriction does turning off virtual to
physical address translation place on the interrupt service routine
code?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The microcode used for starting the exception service routine is very
similar to the microcode that is used for starting the interrupt
service routine.  Are there any differences?  With these differences
in mind perhaps you can combine the states used for interrupt and
exception handling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You do not need to worry about nested interrupts or exceptions for this assignment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you were unable to finish Lab 4 and are hence starting from Lab 3,
please make a note of this in the readme file. You will be unable to
simulate the page fault exception, protection exception and timer
interrupt if the requirements of Lab 4 are not done.</p>
</li>
