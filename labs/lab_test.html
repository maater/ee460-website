<h2>EE460N: Instructions for Lab Assignment Testing For Previous Labs</h2>

<p>Because some labs in this class are dependent on the previous lab working
correctly, we allow you to run our tests on the previous lab assignment as an
aid to ensure a correctly functioning starting point. <strong>Passing all the
  tests does not mean that your Lab is correct!</strong> An incorrect program
may just happen to behave correctly on our test cases. <strong>It is your
  responsibility to ensure that your Labs are correct.</strong></p>

<p>Despite what some of these commands may imply about late grading, note that
we do not accept late assignments under any circumstances. These commands will
have no effect on your lab grade, and are only available for your testing
benefit. Running these commands will overwrite the grade report shown when
running the -results command, but note that we still have record of your
original grade report. If you wish to keep a copy of your original grade
report, you may save your own copy locally before running these tests.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>SSH into grader1 with the following command and your ECE LRC user ID and
password:</p>
<pre><tt>ssh grader1.ece.utexas.edu</tt></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>After typing your username and password, submit your files with the
following command:</p>
<pre><tt>submit-ee360n -late <i>&lt;filename1&gt;</i> <i>&lt;filename2&gt;</i> <i>...</i></tt></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may check the files submitted with the following command:</p>
<pre><tt>submit-ee360n -latels</tt></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final step in submitting your program for testing. Generate your new
grade report with the following command:</p>
<pre><tt>submit-ee360n -lategrade</tt></pre>
<p>After you run this command <b>read the prompt carefully</b> to proceed with
your grade report. You may terminate your SSH session if you wish. If you do
not terminate your SSH session, after some time, you will receive a message
displaying your full grade report for the test, final score included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can confirm your grade reported in step 4 with the following
command:</p>
<pre><tt>submit-ee360n -results <i>K</i></tt></pre>
<p>Where <i>K</i> is the lab assignment number you are verifying results
for.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note 1: You will only be able to run tests for the lab immediately previous to the lab currently due. For example, if Lab 4 is currently due, you will only be able to test your Lab 3. </p>
<p>Note 2: currently the submit script works only on grader1. </p>
<p>Note 3: You may run:</p>
<pre><tt>submit-ee360n</tt></pre>
<p>(with no parameters, exactly as shown above) to display the various options
submit-ee360n supports.</p>
