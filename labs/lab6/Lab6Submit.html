Submission Instructions for Lab Assignment 6<br />

You must use the following naming convention for the files in Lab 6.
<ul>
<li>
lc3bsim6.c - The C source code for your pipelined LC-3b simulator.
</li>
<li>
ucode6     - The microcode file for your pipelined simulator
</li>


</ul>
<p>
You may not submit more than two files for Lab 6.
</p>

<p>Please confirm that your file compiles (by using <tt>gcc -ansi
  lc3bsim6.c</tt>) and runs on any <b>ECE LRC linux machine before submitting
  your program</b>.  Please issue command <tt>uname</tt> and make sure the
output is Linux. Note that sunfire machines are not Linux machines.</p>

<p>
<font color="red">Also, please remove the printf statements you put in
your program for debugging. The only output to the screen from your
simulator should be the output initiated by the shell code we have
provided. </font>

<p>

</ul>

<p>In order to help us assign you the grades, we need your names and UTEIDs at
