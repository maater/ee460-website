<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>For this assignment, you will write a simulator for the pipelined
LC-3b. The simulator will take two input files:</p>

<ol>
<li>A file entitled <tt>ucode</tt> which holds the control store that is
      located in the DE stage of the pipeline.</li>
<li>A file entitled <tt>isaprogram</tt> holding an assembled LC-3b program.</li>
</ol>

<p>The simulator will execute the input LC-3b program using the control
store and the code you write inside the simulator functions to direct
the simulation of the datapath and memory components of the LC-3b.</p>

<p>Note: The file <tt>isaprogram</tt> is the output you generated in Lab
Assignment 1. This file should consist of 4 hex characters per
line. Each line of 4 hex characters should be prefixed with &lsquo;0x&rsquo;. For
example, the instruction <code>NOT R1, R6</code> would have been assembled to
<code>1001001110111111</code>. This instruction would be represented in the
isaprogram file as <code>0x93BF</code>. The file ucode is an ASCII file that
consists of 64 rows and 23 columns of zeros and ones.</p>

<p>Similar to the simulator you used in Lab 3, the simulator for this lab
is partitioned into two main sections, the shell, which allows a user
to control the simulator, and the simulation routines, which carry out
the simulation.</p>

<h2>The Shell</h2>

<p>The purpose of the shell is to provide the user with commands to
control the execution of the simulator. In order to extract
information from the simulator, a file named <tt>dumpsim</tt> will be created
to hold information requested from the simulator. The shell supports
the following commands:</p>

<ol>
<li>go &ndash; simulate the program until a HALT instruction is executed.</li>
<li>run &lt;n&gt; &ndash; simulate the execution of the machine for n cycles</li>
<li>mdump &lt;low&gt; &lt;high&gt; &ndash; dump the contents of memory, from location low to location high, to the screen and the dump file.</li>
<li>rdump &ndash; dump the current cycle count, the contents of R0&ndash;R7, PC, condition codes to the screen and the dump file.</li>
<li>idump &ndash; dump the current cycle count, the contents of R0&ndash;R7, PC,
      condition codes, and the state of the pipeline latches to the screen and the
      dump file. This function also dumps the values of stall signals.</li>
<li>? &ndash; print out a list of all shell commands.</li>
<li>quit &ndash; quit the shell</li>
</ol>

<p>Do not change any of the code related to the shell. We will be using
these functions to grade your program and our grading script expects
the output format provided by these functions.</p>

<h2>The Simulation Routines</h2>

<p>The simulator simulates one processor cycle via the <code>cycle()</code>
function. This function calls the following functions, each of which
corresponds to one of the stages in the pipeline:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>FETCH_stage();</code></li>
<li><code>DE_stage();</code></li>
<li><code>AGEX_stage();</code></li>
<li><code>MEM_stage();</code></li>
<li><code>SR_stage();</code></li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>SR_stage()</code> function has been written for you to get you started. Your
job is to write the remaining four functions. Note: For each stage,
your code must fully implement the structures in that stage of the
pipeline. Refer to the description of the pipeline, the figures of the
pipeline stages, and the list of control signals to figure out what to
implement in each pipeline stage.</p>

<p>The simulator code provided contains two structures that hold the
state of the pipeline latches: <code>PS</code> and <code>NEW_PS</code>. <code>PS</code> contains the state of
the pipeline latches during the current clock cycle. <code>NEW_PS</code> contains the new
values of the pipeline latches that will be latched at the end of the
current clock cycle. At the end of each cycle, <code>NEW_PS</code> is assigned to
<code>PS</code> (<code>PS = NEW_PS</code>) to simulate the latching of data values into the pipeline
registers. You need to make use of these structures while writing the
simulation routines. When you need to read a value from a pipeline
latch, you need to read it from the <code>PS</code> structure. When you need to
update the value in a pipeline latch, you should update it in the
<code>NEW_PS</code> structure. In other words, the <code>PS</code> structure should always be used
in the right-hand side of an assignment statement, and the <code>NEW_PS</code> structure
should always be used on the left-hand side of an assignment
statement. Please carefully examine the code related to these two
structures as you have to use them in the code you write.</p>

<p>We have also provided you with interfaces to the instruction and data
caches: <code>icache_access</code> and <code>dcache_access</code> functions. You must use these
functions to perform accesses to the I-Cache and the D-Cache.</p>

<h2>What To Do</h2>

<p>First, read and understand the documentation
for the pipelined version of LC-3b you are going to implement. You may download
it from the link below:</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="lab6_documentation.pdf" title="Lab Assignment 6 Documentation"><tt>lab6_documentation.pdf</tt></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Your job is to implement the pipelined LC-3b microarchitecture exactly
as it is described in the above documentation. Some of the logic
blocks in the pipeline are left for you to implement. It is advisable
that you design these logic blocks on paper before you start writing
the simulator code.</p>

<p>The shell has been written for you. From your ECE LRC account, copy
the following file to your work directory:</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="lc3bsim6.c"><tt>lc3bsim6.c</tt></a>
</blockquote>

<p>At present, the shell reads in the control store and input program and
initializes the machine. It is your responsibility to write the
correct control store file and to augment the shell with the
simulation routines that simulate the activity of the pipelined
LC-3b. In particular, you are to write the code to perform the
activities of the first four pipeline stages as described above.</p>

<p>Add your code to the end of the shell code. Do not modify the shell code.</p>

<p>The accuracy of your simulator is your main priority. It is suggested
that you start out by writing a one instruction program and simulating
the execution of this program cycle by cycle using the idump command
to verify that the instruction propagates correctly through the
pipeline. We suggest that you start out by making sure a simple
instruction, like an ADD, flows correctly through the pipeline. Then
you can move on to more complicated instructions like loads and
branches. Try instructions one by one to make sure each works as it is
supposed to. After you get the memory and control instructions working
correctly, you can try more complicated programs that contain
dependencies and test whether or not your pipeline stalls correctly.</p>

<p>You are not responsible for implementing the RTI instruction. You are
also not required to support exception/interrupt handling, although
you are encouraged to think about the issues related to the handling
of exceptions and interrupts on a pipelined microarchitecture.</p>

<p>Because we will be evaluating your code in Unix, you must be sure your
code compiles on one of the ECE Linux machines 
using gcc with the <tt>-ansi</tt> flag and runs
correctly. This means that you need to write your code in C such that
it conforms to the ANSI C standard. If the value of a control signal
is a don't care, you should set that signal to 0. We will be checking
the state of the internal pipeline latches and architectural state
when testing your simulator. <strong>To receive full
credit, the values stored in these latches by your simulator should
exactly match the values stored in these latches by a correct
simulator.</strong></p>

<h2>What To Turn In</h2>

<p>Please submit your lab assignment electronically on grader1.
You will submit the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><tt>lc3bsim6.c</tt> &ndash; adequately documented source code of your simulator.</li>
<li><tt>ucode6</tt> &ndash; microcode file.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Optional: Support for Exceptions</h2>

<p>For this lab, you may optionally implement support for exceptions and the
RTI instruction. <b>Note that implementing these optional additions will
  receive no extra credit; this is merely for those students who wish to
  challenge themselves as an additional learning experience.</b> Before
implementing exception support into the pipeline, please first complete the
basic pipeline functionality.</p>

<p>As a starting point for exception support in the LC-3b pipeline, we
recommend making many simplifying assumptions. First, begin with support for
only two kinds of exceptions: unknown opcode and unaligned access (LDW/STW only
initially). The unknown opcode exception should use exception vector x01, and
the unaligned access exception should use exception vector x02.</p>

<p>Assume that all programs will only execute in Supervisor Mode with
PSR[15]=0. Thus, no support for two levels of privilege will be required. As a
consequence, assume that R6 will always contain the Supervisor Stack Pointer;
thus, no switching of stack pointers will be necessary.</p> 

<p>Note that both RTI and the steps to initiate the exception handler are
complex processes: they each require multiple memory accesses, stack pointer
modification, and change in PC. The current LC-3b pipeline resolves control
instructions in the MEM stage of the pipeline. Because all exceptions can be
detected by this stage, modifying the pipeline to support exceptions will
require an additional exception state machine in the MEM stage. We can add
additional bits to the MEM stage Pipeline Registers to keep track of whether an
exception has been detected, and which state of exception processing the MEM
stage is currently carrying out in the case of a detected exception. RTI can be
implemented with a similar state machine in the decode stage of the pipeline.
These state machines will stall the pipeline until they complete.</p>

<p>To support the stack operations required by the RTI instruction and the
exception handler setup steps, it is easiest to assume the MEM stage has access
to direct R6 read and write ports from the Register File. Appropriate
dependency stall logic will need to be included to wait on previous
instructions' potential writes to R6. Similar design principles can be applied
to the CC (which need to be saved/restored onto the System Stack as part of the
PSR).</p>

<p>Both the RTI instruction and the exception handler setup steps will
require additional logic to ensure earlier stages of the pipeline are properly
invalidated; this can be implemented similarly to the BR.STALL mechanism used
by all control instructions currently in the pipeline. One challenge to
consider is that while an RTI can be detected at the same time as other control
instructions, memory exceptions cannot be detected until AGEX.</p>

<p>Please contact the TA Faruk for additional details if you wish to implement
support for exceptions.</p>
