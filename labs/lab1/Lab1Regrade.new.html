<h1>Lab Assignment 1 Regrade Instructions</h1>
<em>Deadline: Sunday, February 17th at 11:59pm</em>

<ol>
<li>
  <p>You are eligible to receive one half of the points you lost, i.e. your
  final grade will be the arithmetic mean of the original grade and the regrade
  score.</p>
  <p> Thus, if your original grade was 50, and your resubmission is perfect, you
  will receive an additional 25 points for a total grade of 75.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>You must follow the same submission instructions provided with the
  original Lab 1. You should submit your files using the <tt>submit-ee360n</tt>
  script. You can use the <tt>-results</tt> option to verify your current
  grade. The <tt>-test</tt> option will be available as described in Dr. Patt's
  email to the class.</p>
  <p>Note that you will have to submit both files (<tt>assembler.c</tt> and
  <tt>toupper.asm</tt>) for a regrade. So even if only your assembly language
  program is changed, you will have to resubmit your assembler also.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>Many people have lost points in <tt>toupper.asm</tt>. Please make sure
  that your <tt>toupper.asm</tt> assembles correctly with the assembler we
  provided.  At this point you can also test the program in your Lab 2
  simulator to make sure it also produces the correct results.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Please note that resubmission will not be possible for any other Lab in
  this class under ANY cirucmstances! You are responsible for extensively
  testing each of your Labs under the Unix environment to verify proper
  operation for all potential input cases.</b></p>
