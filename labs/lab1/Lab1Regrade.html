<h1>Lab Assignment 1 Regrade Instructions</h1>

<p>We will process the regrades
in two phases: first the unfairly penalized cases (a few careless
simple mistakes), and then general resubmissions.</p>

<p><strong>In both cases, only you and your original partner may modify your originally submitted files!</strong></p>

<h2>Unfairly Penalized Cases (One or Two Careless Simple Mistakes)</h2>
<em>Deadline: Sunday, March 6th at 11:59pm</em>
<p>We consider an <tt>assembler.c</tt> submission unfairly penalized if one or two <strong>small</strong> errors in it were caught by a large number
of test cases (ten or more). The typical errors are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hard coded input/output file name(s)</li>
<li>Invalid output file format</li>
<li>Wrong assumptions about the input file format</li>
<li>No <code>return 0</code> or <code>exit(0)</code> at the end of <code>main()</code> function</li>
</ol>

<p>If you think your assembler.c program was unfairly penalized, please send an
email to Milad at 
<a href="mailto:miladhashemi@mail.utexas.edu">miladhashemi@mail.utexas.edu</a> with a list
of the bugs and the corrected version of the program. <strong>Do not fix any bugs that do not
fall into the &ldquo;unfairly penalized&rdquo; category as defined
above!</strong> (if you think that you had a simple mistake and that is not
listed above, please email Milad). You will be able to fix
any other bugs in a general resubmission. The deadline for this email is Sunday,
March 6th at 11:59pm.</p>

<p>We will not consider any <tt>insert.asm</tt> files unfairly penalized.</p>

<p>Your grade for Lab 1 will be replaced with the grade earned by the corrected version. This grade will count as the original grade for
the purposes of general resubmission described below.</p>

<h2>General Resubmissions</h2>
<em>Deadline: Sunday, March 6th at 11:59pm</em>
<p>You may resubmit your solution to Lab 1 for a regrade under the following conditions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You are eligible to receive one half of the
points you lost, i.e. your final grade will be the arithmetic mean of the original grade and the regrade score.</p>
<p> Thus, if your original grade was 50, and your resubmission is
perfect, you will receive an additional 25 points for a total grade of
75.</p>
</li>

<li><p>You must follow the same submission instructions provided with the original Lab 1. You should submit your files using the <tt>submit-ee360n</tt>
script.</p>
<p>Note that you will have to submit both files (<tt>assembler.c</tt> and <tt>insert.asm</tt>) for a regrade. So even if
only your assembly language program is changed, you will have to resubmit
your assembler also.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Due to Lab 3's submission deadline on Sunday, February 27th at 11:59 pm, we
will implement resubmission in two parts. We do not want Lab 1 resubmission
affecting your Lab 3 submission.  Thus, you may submit your new files anytime
starting Thursday, February 17th 12:00 pm (noon) until Sunday, February 20th
11:59 pm. Lab 3 submission will then open until Sunday, February 27th at 11:59
pm. At this point, Lab 1 resubmission will re-open until Sunday, March 6th at
11:59 pm.</p>
<p><strong>Under no circumstances will files submitted after the deadline be considered for a regrade!</strong></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Please compile and test your program before submitting, on any ECE
linux machine (sunfire machines are not linux machines).  This is the
platform we will be using to test your program. If your new files
generate compile errors or segmentation faults, your regrade score
will be 0 (for that part).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Many people have lost points in <tt>insert.asm</tt>. Please make sure that your <tt>insert.asm</tt> assembles correctly with the assembler we provided. At this point you can also test the program in your Lab 2 simulator to make sure it also produces the correct results.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Please note that resubmission will not be possible for any other Lab in
  this class under ANY cirucmstances! You are responsible for extensively
  testing each of your Labs under the Unix environment to verify proper
  operation for all potential input cases.</b></p>
