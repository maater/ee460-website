<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The purpose of this lab is to reinforce the concepts of assembly
language and assemblers. In this lab assignment, you will write an
LC-3b Assembler, whose job will be to translate assembly language
source code into the machine language (ISA) of the LC-3b. You will
also write a program to solve a problem in the LC-3b Assembly
Language.</p>

<p>In Lab Assignments 2 and 3, you will close the loop by completing the design
of two types of simulators for the LC-3b, and test your assembler by having the
simulators execute the program you wrote and assembled in this lab.</p>

<h2>Part I: Write an assembler for the LC-3b Assembly Language</h2>

<p>The general format of a line of assembly code, which will be the input
to your assembler, is as follows:</p>

<pre>        label opcode operands ; comments</pre>

<p>The leftmost field on a line will be the label field. Valid labels consist
of from one to 20 alphanumeric characters (i.e., a letter of the alphabet, or a
decimal digit), starting with a letter of the alphabet. A valid label cannot be
the same as an opcode or a pseudo-op. A valid label must start with a character
other than &lsquo;x&rsquo; and consist solely of alphanumeric characters
&ndash; a to z, 0 to 9. The label is optional, i.e., an assembly language
instruction can leave out the label. <font color=red>A valid label cannot be
  IN, OUT, GETC, or PUTS. The entire assembly process, including labels, is
  case-insensitive.(updated - 01/31/13).</font> A label is necessary if the
program is to branch to that instruction or if the location contains data that
is to be addressed explicitly. </p>

<p>The opcode field can be any one of the following instructions:</p>

<pre>ADD, AND, BR, HALT, JMP, JSR, JSRR, LDB, LDW, LEA, NOP, 
NOT, RET, LSHF, RSHFL, RSHFA, RTI, STB, STW, TRAP, XOR</pre>

<p>The number of operands depends on the operation being performed. It
can consist of register names, labels, or constants (immediates). If a hexadecimal
constant is used, it must be prefixed with the &lsquo;<code>x</code>&rsquo;
character. Similarly, decimal constants must be prefixed with a
&lsquo;<code>#</code>&rsquo; character.</p>

<p>Optionally, an instruction can be commented, which is good style if
the comment contains meaningful information. Comments follow the
semicolon and are not interpreted by the Assembler. Note that the
semicolon prefaces the comment, and a newline ends the comment. Other
delimiters are not allowed.</p>

<p>In this lab assignment, the <code>NOP</code> instruction translates into the
machine language instruction <code>0x0000</code>.</p>

<p>Note that you should also implement the <code>HALT</code> instruction as
<code>TRAP x25</code>. Other <code>TRAP</code> commands (<code>GETC</code>, <code>IN</code>, <code>OUT</code>, <code>PUTS</code>) need not
be recognized by your assembler for this assignment.</p>

<p>In addition to LC-3b instructions, an assembly language also contains
pseudo-ops, sometimes called macro directives. These are messages from
the programmer to the assembler that assist the assembler in
performing the translation process. In the case of our LC-3b Assembly
Language, we will only require three pseudo-ops to make our lives
easier: <code>.ORIG</code>, <code>.END</code>, and <code>.FILL</code>.</p>

<p>An assembly language program will consist of some number of assembly
language instructions, delimited by <code>.ORIG</code> and
<code>.END</code>. The pseudo-op <code>.END</code> is a message to the
assembler designating the end of the assembly language source
program. The <code>.ORIG</code> pseudo-op provides two functions: it
designates the start of the source program, and it specifies the
location of the first instruction in the object module to be
produced. For example, <code>.ORIG <var>N</var></code> means &ldquo;the next instruction
will be assigned to location <var>N</var>.&rdquo; The pseudo-op <code>.FILL <var>W</var></code>
assigns the value <var>W</var> to the corresponding location in the
object module. <var>W</var> is regarded as a word (16-bit value) by the <code>.FILL</code>
pseudo-op.</p>

<p>The task of the assembler is that of line-by-line translation. The
input is an assembly language file, and the output is an object (ISA)
file (consisting of hexadecimal digits). To make it a little more
concrete, here is a sample assembly language program:</p>

<pre><code>;This program counts from 10 to 0 
        .ORIG x3000       
        LEA R0, TEN       ;This instruction will be loaded into memory location x3000
        LDW R1, R0, #0 
START   ADD R1, R1, #-1 
        BRZ DONE 
        BR START 
                          ;blank line 
DONE    TRAP x25          ;The last executable instruction 
TEN     .FILL x000A       ;This is 10 in 2's comp, hexadecimal 
        .END              ;The pseudo-op, delimiting the source program </code></pre>

<p>And its corresponding ISA program:</p>

<pre><code>       0x3000
       0xE005
       0x6200 
       0x127F 
       0x0401 
       0x0FFD 
       0xF025 
       0x000A</code></pre>

<p>Note that each line of the output is a four digit hex number, prefixed
with &ldquo;<code>0x</code>&rdquo;, representing the 16-bit machine instruction. The reason that 
your output should be prefixed with &ldquo;<code>0x</code>&rdquo; is because the simulator for
Lab Assignment 2 that you will write in C expects the input data to be 
expressed in hex, and C syntax requires hex data to start with "0x".
Also note that <code>BR</code> instruction is assembled as the unconditional branch,
<code>BRnzp</code>.</p>

<p>When this program is loaded into the simulator, the instruction <code>0xE005</code>
will be loaded into the memory location specified by the first line of the
program, which is <code>x3000</code>. As instructions consist of two bytes, the
second instruction, <code>0x6200</code>, will be loaded into memory location
<code>x3002</code>. Thus, memory locations <code>x3000</code> to <code>x300C</code> will contain the
program.</p>

<p>We have included below another example of an assembly language
program, and the result of the assembly process. In this case, the
<code>.ORIG</code> pseudo-op tells the assembler to place the program at
memory address #4096.</p>

<pre><code>        .ORIG #4096 
A       LEA R1, Y
        LDW R1, R1, #0
        LDW R1, R1, #0 
        ADD R1, R1, R1 
        ADD R1, R1, x-10  ;x-10 is the negative of x10 
        BRN A 
        HALT 
Y       .FILL #263 
        .FILL #13 
        .FILL #6 
        .END </code></pre>

<p>would be assembled into the following:</p>

<pre><code>       0x1000 
       0xE206
       0x6240
       0x6240 
       0x1241 
       0x1270 
       0x09FA 
       0xF025 
       0x0107 
       0x000D 
       0x0006</code></pre>

<p>Important note: even though this program will assemble correctly, it may not do anything useful.</p>

<h3>The Assembly Process</h3>

<p>Your assembler should make two passes of the input file. In the first
pass, all the labels should be bound to specific memory addresses. You
create a symbol table to contain those bindings. Whenever a new
instruction label is encountered in the input file, it is assigned to
the current memory address.</p>

<p>The second pass performs the translation from assembly language to
machine language, one line at a time. It is during this pass that the
output file should be generated.</p>

<p>You should write your program to take two command-line arguments. The
first argument is the name of a file that contains a program written
in LC-3b assembly language, which will be the input to your
program. The second argument is the name of the file to which your
program will write its output. In other words, this is the name of the
file which will contain the LC-3b machine code corresponding to the
input assembly language file. For example, we should be able to run
your assembler with the following command-line input:</p>

<pre><tt>assemble &lt;source.asm&gt; &lt;output.obj&gt;</tt></pre>

<p>where <tt>assemble</tt> is the name of the executable file corresponding
to your compiled and linked program; <tt>source.asm</tt> is the input
assembly language file, and <tt>output.obj</tt>; is the output file that
will contain the assembled code.</p>

<p>You will need to include some basic error checking within your
assembler to handle improperly constructed assembly language
programs. Your assembler must detect three types of errors and must
return three different error codes. The errors to be detected are
<em>undefined labels</em> (error code 1), <em>invalid opcodes</em>
(error code 2), and <em>invalid constants</em> (error code 3). An
invalid constant is a constant that is too large to be assembled into
an LC-3b instruction. If the <code>.ORIG</code> pseudo-op contains an
address that is greater than an address that can be represented in the
16-bit address space, your program should return error code 3. Also,
if the <code>.ORIG</code> statement specifies an address that is not word-aligned,
your program should return error code 3. Your program must return the
error codes via the <code>exit(<var>n</var>)</code> function, where <var>n</var> denotes the
error code number. If the assembly language program does not contain
any errors, you must exit with error code 0. Exiting with the correct codes
is very important since they will be used in the grading process.
On Linux, you can determine the exit code of your assembler by executing
<tt>echo $?</tt> right after running the assembler.</p>

<p>This error checking is the bare minimum that we expect. You can return
error code 4 for any other errors you find. Just be sure that the
errors don't fall within the first three categories specified above.</p>

<h3>Examples of error codes</h3>
<h4>Error code 1: undefined label</h4>
<p>A label is used by an instruction but the label is not in the symbol table, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<pre><code>	.ORIG x3000
	 LEA R0, DATA1  ; DATA1 is not defined in the assembly code
	.END</code></pre>
</li>
<li> 
<pre><code>	.ORIG x3000
	JSR ADD         ; JSR is parsed as an opcode, and ADD is an
	                ; illegal label. While illegal labels
	                ; should return error code 4, we accept 
	                ; error code 1 for this case, too.
	.END</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Error code 2: invalid opcode</h4>
<p>An invalid opcode is one that is not defined in the LC-3b ISA, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<pre><code>	.ORIG x1000
	MUL R0, R1, R2 
	.END</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code>	.ORIG x1000
	ABC 
	.END </code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Error code 3: invalid constant</h4>
<p>An invalid constant is a constant that is too large to be assembled into an LC-3b instruction. An odd constant that follows <code>.ORIG</code> is also an invalid constant.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<pre><code>	.ORIG x1000
	ADD R0, R1, #20  ; error 
	.END </code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code>	.ORIG x1001       ; error 
	ADD R0, R1, #1
	.END</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Error code 4: other error</h4>
<p>These errors which do not belong to any of the above categories.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<pre><code>	.ORIG x1000
	 ADD R0, R1       ; wrong number of operands
	.END</code></pre>
</li>
<li> 
<pre><code>	.ORIG x1000
	.FILL             ; missing operand
	.END </code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code>	.ORIG x1000
	 ADD R1, #2, R3   ; unexpected operand
	.END</code></pre>
</li>
<li> 
<pre><code>	.ORIG x1000
	 ADD R9, R0, #1   ; R9 is an invalid register number
	.END</code></pre>
</li>
<li> 
<pre><code>	.ORIG x1000
	 ADD R1, R0, 1    ; 1 is an invalid operand (neither a register nor an immediate)
	.END</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If a label and an instruction that uses it are too far apart and the 
offset cannot be specified properly in the machine code, you should produce
error code 4.</p>

<p>Your assembler should accept an &ldquo;empty&rdquo; program, i.e. one with just a valid <code>.ORIG</code> and a <code>.END</code>.
E.g. the following assembly program would be assembled to only one line containing the starting
address (<code>0x3000</code>).</p>
<pre><code>	.ORIG x3000
	.END</code></pre>

<p> Note: your assembler needs to recognize only labels as operands for 
<code>LEA</code>, <code>BR</code>, and <code>JSR</code> instructions. For example, if the following line is in an input
assembly language program, your assembler can exit with error code 4:</p>

<pre><code>	LEA R1, x100</code></pre>

<h2>Part II: Write a program to solve the following problem</h2>

<p>Write an LC-3b assembly language program that converts to upper-case a
null-terminated character string. Each element in the character string is a
byte value containing the ASCII code of a lower-case character (or the null
termination).</p>

<p>Your assembly language program must begin at memory location
<code>x3000</code>. You may assume that before your program is loaded into
memory and run, address <code>x4000</code> contains the starting address of the
first element in the character string, and address <code>x4002</code> contains
the starting address of where to store the null-terminated upper-case character
string.</p>

<p>You will have no way of determining if your assembly language code works
(yet!), but you can use it to determine if your assembler works! Despite this,
<b>Part II will still be graded for correctness.</b></p>

<p>Hint: Be sure not to overwrite any existing elements.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p><strong>Important note: because we will be evaluating your code in
Unix, please be sure your code compiles using gcc with the
<code>-ansi</code> flag.</strong> This means that you need to write your code
in C such that it conforms to the ANSI C standard.</p>
<p>You can use the following command to compile your code:</p>
<pre><tt>gcc -ansi -o assemble assembler.c</tt></pre>
<p>You should also make sure that your code runs correctly on one of the ECE
linux machines.</p>
<p>To complete Lab Assignment 1, you will need to turn in the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
A C file called "assembler.c" containing an adequately documented listing 
of your LC-3b Assembler.
</li>
<li>
A source listing (LC-3b Assembly Language) of the program described 
above called <font color=red>"toupper.asm". (Updated: 01/30/13)</font>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Submit your code electronically following the posted <a href="Lab1Submit.html" title="Lab Assignment 1 Submission Instructions">instructions</a>.</p>
<!--
<p><b>Submission will be handled electronically, instructions TBD.</b></p>
-->

<h4>Things to watch for:</h4>

<p>Be sure that your assembler can handle comments on any line, including
lines that contain pseudo-ops and lines that contain only comments. Be
careful with comments that follow a <code>HALT</code>, <code>NOP</code> or
<code>RET</code> instructions &ndash; these instructions take no operand.</p>

<p>Your assembler should allow hexadecimal and decimal constants after
both ISA instructions, like <code>ADD</code>, and pseudo-ops, like 
<code>.FILL</code>.</p>

<p>The whole assembly process is case insensitive. That is, the labels, 
opcodes, operands, and pseudo-ops can be in upper case, lower case, or both, 
and are still interpreted the same. The parser function given in the 
<a href="Lab1Functions.html" title="Lab Assignment 1 Useful Code">useful code</a> page converts every line into 
lower case before parsing it.</p>

<p>You can assume that there will be at most 255 labels in an assembly
program. You can also assume that the number of characters on a line
will not exceed 255.</p>

<p>Your assembler needs to support all 8 variations of <code>BR</code>:</p>

<pre>        BRn LABEL                       BRz LABEL
        BRp LABEL                       BRnz LABEL
        BRnp LABEL                      BRzp LABEL
        BR LABEL                        BRnzp LABEL</pre>
