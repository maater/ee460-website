Lab Assignment 3 <br />
Due: Sunday, February 24th, 11:59 pm <br />
Yale Patt, Instructor<br />
Faruk Guvenilir, Sumedha Bhangale, Stephen Pruett, TAs<br />

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>For this assignment, you will write a cycle-level simulator for the LC-3b. The
simulator will take two input files:</p>

<ol>
<li>A file entitled <tt>ucode3</tt> which holds the control store.</li>
<li>A file entitled <tt>isaprogram</tt> which is an assembled LC-3b program.</li>
</ol>

<p>The simulator will execute the input LC-3b program, using the microcode
to direct the simulation of the microsequencer, datapath, and memory
components of the LC-3b.</p>

<p>Note: The file <tt>isaprogram</tt> is the output file from Lab
Assignment 1. This file should consist of 4 hex characters per
line. Each line of 4 hex characters should be prefixed with '0x'. For
example, the instruction <code>NOT R1, R6</code> would have been assembled to
<code>1001001110111111</code>. This instruction would be represented in the
<tt>isaprogram</tt> file as <code>0x93BF</code>. The file <tt>ucode3</tt> is an ASCII
file that consists of 64 rows and 35 columns of zeros and ones.</p>

<p>The simulator is partitioned into two main sections: the shell and the
simulation routines. We are providing you with the shell. Your job is to write the simulation routines.</p>

<h2>The Shell</h2>

<p>The purpose of the shell is to provide the user with commands to
control the execution of the simulator. In order to extract
information from the simulator, a file named <tt>dumpsim</tt> will be created
to hold information requested from the simulator. The shell supports
the following commands:</p>

<ol>
<li><tt>go</tt> &ndash; simulate the program until a HALT instruction is executed. </li>
<li><tt>run &lt;n&gt;</tt>&ndash; simulate the execution of the machine for n cycles </li>
<li><tt>mdump &lt;low&gt; &lt;high&gt;</tt> &ndash; dump the contents of memory, from location low to location high to the screen and the dump file. For hex addresses, put &ldquo;<tt>0x</tt>&rdquo; in front of the address, eg. <tt>mdump 0x3000 0x3001</tt></li>
<li><tt>rdump</tt> &ndash; dump the current cycle count, the contents of R0-R7, IR, PC, MAR, MDR, and other status information to the screen and the dump file. </li>
<li><tt>?</tt> &ndash; print out a list of all shell commands. </li>
<li><tt>quit</tt> &ndash; quit the shell </li>
</ol>

<h2>The Simulation Routines</h2>

<p>The simulation routines carry out the cycle-by-cycle simulation of the
input LC-3b program. The simulation of any cycle is based on the
contents of the current latches in the system. The simulation consists of
two concurrently executing phases:</p>

<p>The microsequencer phase uses 9 bits from the microinstruction
register and appropriate literals from the datapath to determine the
next microinstruction. Function <code>eval_micro_sequencer</code> evaluates this
phase.</p>

<p>The datapath phase uses 26 bits of the microinstruction to manipulate
the data in the datapath. Each microinstruction must be literally
interpreted. For example, if the <code>GateMDR</code> bit is asserted, then data
must go from the MDR onto the bus. You must also establish an order
for events to occur during a machine cycle. For example, data should
be gated onto the bus first, and loaded into a register at the end of
the cycle. Simulate these events by writing the code for functions
<code>eval_bus_drivers</code>, <code>drive_bus</code> and <code>latch_datapath_values</code>.</p>

<p>We will assume a memory operation takes five cycles to complete. That
is, the ready bit is asserted at the end of the fourth
cycle. Function <code>cycle_memory</code> emulates memory.</p>

<h2>What To Do</h2>

<p>The shell has been written for you. From your ECE LRC account, copy
the following file to your work directory:</p>

<blockquote>
<tt><a href="lc3bsim3.c">lc3bsim3.c</a></tt>
</blockquote>

<p>At present, the shell reads in the microcode and input program and
initializes the machine. It is your responsibility to write the
correct microcode file and to complete the simulation
routines that simulate the activity of the LC-3b microarchitecture.
In particular, you will be writing the five functions described above
(<code>eval_micro_sequencer</code>, <code>cycle_memory</code>, <code>eval_bus_drivers</code>,
<code>drive_bus</code>, and <code>latch_datapath_values</code>).</p>

<p>Add your code to the end of the shell code. Do not modify the shell
code.</p>

<p>The accuracy of your simulator is your main priority. Specifically,
make sure the correct microarchitectural structures sample the correct
signals.</p>


<p>It is your responsibility to verify that your 
simulator is working correctly. You should write programs 
using all of the LC-3b instructions and execute them one cycle at a 
time (run 1). You can use the <tt>rdump</tt> and <tt>mdump</tt> commands to verify that the state of the 
machine is updated correctly after the execution of each cycle.</p>

<p>Because we will be evaluating your code on linux, you must be sure your
code compiles on an ECE linux machine
using gcc with the <tt>-ansi</tt> flag. This means that you need to write 
your code in C such that it conforms to the ANSI C standard. You should 
also make sure that your code runs correctly on one of the ECE linux
machines.</p>

<h2>What To Turn In</h2>

<p>Please <a href="Lab3Submit.html">submit</a> your lab assignment electronically. You will submit the following files:</p>
<!--<p>Submission is currently closed, but you will submit your lab assignment electronically. You will submit the following files:</p>-->

<ol>
<li><tt>lc3bsim3.c</tt> &ndash; adequately documented source code of your simulator</li>
<li><tt>ucode3</tt> &ndash; your microcode file</li>
</ol>

<h2>Important</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Please make sure that you have made the following correction to the ISA handout.</p>
<p>In Appendix A, please correct the operation of the JSR/JSRR instruction to read:</p>

<pre><code>TEMP = PC&#8224;
if (bit(11)==0)
    PC = BaseR;
else
    PC = PC&#8224; + LSHF(SEXT(PCoffset11), 1);
R7 = TEMP;

* PC&#8224;: incremented PC</code></pre>     
</li>

<li><p>Please note that LEA <b>does NOT</b> set condition codes.</p>
</li>

<li><p>LC-3b registers are 16 bits wide. However, when you perform arithmetic
or bitwise operations in C on <code>int</code> data types on the Linux x86
machines you are using 32 bits. Therefore, you must be careful about not
keeping the higher 16 bits of the results in the architectural state. The shell
code includes a macro called <code>Low16bits</code> that you can use to avoid
this problem.</p></li>

<li><p>The control signals in your ucode3 file <strong>must</strong> be encoded
according to Tables C.1 and C.2 in Appendix C. For each signal, the first
(leftmost or the topmost) signal value must be encoded as 0, the next value as
1, the value after that as 2 (binary 10) and so on. For example, Table C.1
lists the signal values for the two bit signal ALUK as follows: ADD, AND, XOR,
PASSA. This means that ADD must be encoded as binary 00, AND as 01, XOR as 10,
and PASSA as 11. Please use a 0 whenever a particular signal is a don't
care.</p></li>
