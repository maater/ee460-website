Do we need to implement the TRAP routines?

<p>

<font color="blue">
No. Whenever a TRAP instruction is processed, after the last state, PC
will be set to 0, if you implement the TRAP instruction correctly. The
simulator halts whenever PC becomes 0.

What could be the cause of "Warning: Extra bit(s) in control store file ucode."?

<p>

<font color="blue">
This means that the ucode file has more than 35 columns. One reason
why this can happen is if you've transferred the ucode file from
Windows to Unix. Run <tt>dos2unix</tt> program on UNIX machines to remove the
extra control characters inserted by Windows. You can do this by typing:
<pre>dos2unix ucode</pre>
on any LRC SunOS or Linux machine. If this doesn't work, check to make
sure that your ucode file has at most 35 columns.

What is <tt>CYCLE_COUNT</tt>? Is this the counter for memory access?
<p>

<font color="blue">
<tt>CYCLE_COUNT</tt> is a global variable used by the simulator to
count the number of machine cycles elapsed since the program started
execution. Do not change this variable. You will need to use another
variable for simulating memory latency.

How do we handle Memory Mapped I/O for this lab?

<p>

<font color="blue">
 You do not need to implement Memory Mapped I/O for this lab.

<hr>
<li>
<font color="blue">

 You may assume that the code running on your simulator has been
 assembled correctly and that the instructions your simulator sees
 comply with the ISA specifications
</font>

<hr>

<li>
<font color="blue">
In your code that you write for lab 2, do not assign the current latches
to the next latches. This is already done in the shell code
</font>

I am getting values like xFFFFFFFF in my registers when they should be xFFFF instead, why is this?
<br>
<font color="blue">
The variables in your c program are 32 bit values, so the nubmer -1 is xFFFFFFFF.
You need to make sure that when you store values in a variable you mask them properly.
For instance you would need to assign the var1 from var2 the statment var1 = var2 & 0xFFFF.
This zeros out the top 16 bits before writing it into var1.
