Lab Assignment 2<br />
Due: Sunday, February 10, 11:59 pm<br />

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>For this assignment, you will write an instruction-level simulator for the LC-3b. The
simulator will take one input file entitled <tt>isaprogram</tt>, which is an assembled LC-3b program.</p>

<p>The simulator will execute the input LC-3b program, one instruction at a time,
modifying the architectural state of the LC-3b after each instruction.</p>

<p>Note: The file <tt>isaprogram</tt> is the output file from Lab
Assignment 1. This file should consist of 4 hex characters per
line. Each line of 4 hex characters should be prefixed with '0x'. For
example, the instruction <code>NOT R1, R6</code> is assembled to
<code>1001001110111111</code>. This instruction would be represented in the
<tt>isaprogram</tt> file as <code>0x93BF</code>.</p>

<p>The simulator is partitioned into two main sections: the shell and the simulation
routines. We are providing you with the shell. Your job is to write the simulation routines.</p>

<h2>The Shell</h2>

<p>The purpose of the shell is to provide the user with commands to
control the execution of the simulator. The shell accepts one or more
ISA programs as arguments and loads them into the memory image.  
In order to extract information from the simulator, a file named <tt>dumpsim</tt> will be created
to hold information requested from the simulator. The shell supports
the following commands:</p>

<ol>
<li><tt>go</tt> &ndash; simulate the program until a HALT instruction is executed. </li>
<li><tt>run &lt;n&gt;</tt> &ndash; simulate the execution of the machine for n instructions </li>
<li><tt>mdump &lt;low&gt; &lt;high&gt;</tt> &ndash; dump the contents of memory, from location <b>low</b> to location <b>high</b> to the screen and the dump file </li>
<li><tt>rdump</tt> &ndash; dump the current instruction count, the contents of R0&ndash;R7, PC, and condition codes to the screen and the dump file. </li>
<li><tt>?</tt> &ndash; print out a list of all shell commands. </li>
<li><tt>quit</tt> &ndash; quit the shell </li>
</ol>

<h2>The Simulation Routines</h2>

<p>The simulation routines carry out the instruction-level simulation of the 
input LC-3b program. During the execution of an instruction, the 
simulator should take the current architectural state 
and modify it according to the ISA description 
of the instruction in <a href="../../handouts/new_byte.pdf">Appendix A</a>. The
architectural state includes the PC, the general purpose registers, the condition
codes and the memory image. The state is modeled by the following C code:</p>

<pre><code>#define WORDS_IN_MEM    0x08000 
#define LC_3b_REGS 8

typedef struct System_Latches_Struct{

  int PC,                /* program counter */
    N,                   /* n condition bit */
    Z,                   /* z condition bit */
    P;                   /* p condition bit */
  int REGS[LC_3b_REGS];  /* register file. */
} System_Latches;

int MEMORY[WORDS_IN_MEM][2];</code></pre>

<p>The shell code we provide includes the skeleton of a function named <code>process_instruction</code>,
which is called by the shell to simulate the next instruction. You have to write the code for <code>process_instruction</code> 
to simulate the execution of instructions. You can also write additional functions to make the simulation modular.</p>

<h2>What To Do</h2>

<p>The shell has been written for you. From your ECE LRC account, copy
the following file to your work directory:</p>

<blockquote>
<tt><a href="lc3bsim2.c">lc3bsim2.c</a></tt>
</blockquote>

<p>At present, the shell reads in the input program and initializes the 
machine state. It is your responsibility to complete the 
simulation routines that simulate the instruction execution of the LC-3b.</p>

<p>Add your code to the end of the shell code. Do not modify the shell
code.</p>

<p>The accuracy of your simulator is your main priority. Specifically, make 
sure the architectural state is correctly updated after the execution of 
each instruction.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to verify that your 
simulator is working correctly. You should write one or more programs 
using all of the LC-3b instructions and execute them one instruction at a 
time (run 1). You can use the rdump command to verify that the state of the 
machine is updated correctly after the execution of each instruction.</p>

<p>Since we will be evaluating your code on linux, you must be sure that your 
code compiles on one of the ECE linux machines 
using gcc with the <tt>-ansi</tt> flag. This means that you need to write 
your code in C such that it conforms to the ANSI C standard. You should 
also make sure that your code runs correctly on one of the ECE linux 
machines.</p>

<p>If you need to copy any text files from Windows to Linux (for example, your C program
or your test cases), use the <tt>dos2unix</tt>program to convert them (please
see <a href="../../labs/port.html">instructions</a>). This program will strip
away the extra &lsquo;\r&rsquo; end-of-line characters which are not used in Linux.</p>

<h2>What To Turn In</h2>

<p>Please submit your code electronically following the posted <a href="Lab2Submit.html" title="Lab Assignment 2 Submission Instructions">instructions</a>. You will submit only 
the <tt>lc3bsim2.c</tt> file with adequately documented source code of your simulation routines.</p>

<h2>Important</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>In Appendix A, please correct the operation of the <code>JSR</code>/<code>JSRR</code> instruction to read:  
</p>
<pre><code>TEMP = PC&#8224;
if (bit(11)==0)
    PC = BaseR;
else
    PC = PC&#8224; + LSHF(SEXT(PCoffset11), 1);
R7 = TEMP;

* PC&#8224;: incremented PC</code></pre>
</li>

<li><p>Please note that LEA <b>does NOT</b> set condition codes.</p>
</li>

<li><p>LC-3b registers are 16 bits wide. However, when you perform
arithmetic or bitwise operations in C on <code>int</code> data types on
the Linux x86 machines you are using 32 bits. Therefore, you must be
careful about not keeping the higher 16 bits of the results in the
architectural state. The shell code includes a macro called
<code>Low16bits</code> that you can use to avoid this problem.</p>
