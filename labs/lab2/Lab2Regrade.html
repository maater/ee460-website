<h1>Lab Assignment 2 Regrade Instructions</h1>

<p>Lab 2 has been graded and the grades have been emailed to each student.</p>

<p>You may resubmit your solution to Lab 2 for a regrade under the following conditions:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>You should modify the file you submitted originally without the aid of anyone else except your original partner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are eligible to receive at least one-half of the
points you lost, i.e. your final grade will be the arithmetic mean of the original grade and the regrade score.</p>

<p>Thus, if your original grade was a 50, and your resubmission is
perfect, you will receive an additional 25 points for a total grade of
75.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You must follow the same submission instructions provided with the original Lab 2. You should submit your file using the submit-ee360n
script.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You may submit your new files anytime starting Wednesday,
February 21st 12:00pm (noon) until Thursday, February 22nd 11:59pm.</p>
   
<p><strong>Under no circumstances will files submitted after the deadline be considered for a regrade!</strong></p>

</li>

<li>
<p>Please make sure that you implement the TRAP instruction as the LC-3b ISA defines in Appendix A.</p>
</li>

<li>
Please compile and test your program before submitting, on any ECE
linux machine (linux01 - linux24.ece.utexas.edu).  This is the
platform we will be using to test your program. If your new files
generate compile errors or segmentation faults, your regrade score
will be 0 (for that part).
</li>
</ol>
