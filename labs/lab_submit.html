<h2>EE460N: Instructions for Lab Assignment Submission</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>SSH into grader1 with the following command and your ECE LRC user ID and
password:</p>
<pre><tt>ssh grader1.ece.utexas.edu</tt></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>After typing your username and password, submit your files with the
following command:</p>
<pre><tt>submit-ee360n <i>&lt;filename1&gt;</i> <i>&lt;filename2&gt;</i> <i>...</i></tt></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may check the files submitted with the following command:</p>
<pre><tt>submit-ee360n -ls</tt></pre>
</li>
<ol>
<li type="a">
<p><b>This step is optional.</b> At this point, if you wish, you may get a
free test of your program at no cost to you. You can do this step at most
once. To do so, type the following command:</p>
<pre><tt>submit-ee360n -test</tt></pre>
<p>After you run this command <b>read the prompt carefully</b> to proceed
with your test. Do NOT terminate your SSH session. After some time, you
will receive a message displaying your score. If you are not happy with
the test result score, you may update your program and restart at step 2
to submit your changes, and proceed to step 4 to complete submission.
However, you will not be able to perform this step (step 3a) again to test
your program and receive a score. If you are happy with the score
reported, you can immediately proceed to step 4.</p>
<p><b>Groups (applicable to labs 1 and 2 only) are permitted a single Test for
  both members. Attempts to abuse the system WILL be noticed. Violators of this
  policy will NOT enjoy the consequences when caught.</b></p>
</li>
</ol>
<li>
<p>The final step in submitting your program for actual grading. <b>This
  can only be done ONCE, and WILL determine your final grade on this
  lab.</b> Generate your FINAL grade report with the following
command:</p>
<pre><tt>submit-ee360n -grade</tt></pre>
<p>After you run this command <b>read the prompt carefully</b> to proceed with
your grade report. You may terminate your SSH session if you wish. If you do
not terminate your SSH session, after some time, you will receive a message
displaying your full grade report, final score included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please confirm your grade reported in step 4 with the following
command:</p>
<pre><tt>submit-ee360n -results <i>K</i></tt></pre>
<p>Where <i>K</i> is the lab assignment number you are verifying results for.
You can use this at any point in the semester to recheck your lab results
whenever you wish.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note 1: currently the submit script works only on grader1. </p>
<p>Note 2: You may run:</p>
<pre><tt>submit-ee360n</tt></pre>
<p>(with no parameters, exactly as shown above) to display the various options
submit-ee360n supports.</p>
