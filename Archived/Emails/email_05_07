The university does not allow us to hold formal review sessions during the
final exam period.  And, even if they did, we do not have enough lead time 
to do so Tuesday night.  However, Faruk has agreed to hold office hours in 
a classroom on Wednesday around 5pm so students can listen to other students' 
questions and his answers.  We will try to find an available room and post it 
on the class web page on Tuesday.

If Wednesday at 5pm is not good for you, please let me know and I will see
about providing extra office hours.

Yale Patt
