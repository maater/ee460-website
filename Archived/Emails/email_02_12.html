&gt; Professor Patt,
&gt; 
&gt; I was wondering if re-submission for lab 1 was open now 
&gt; that lab 2 was finished.
</font>
Yes, it is.

<font color = "blue">
&gt; If it is, are there any special instructions for re-submitting 
&gt; our lab or do we just follow the same steps as always?  Also, 
&gt; when is the due date for re-submitting our assignment?  Thank you 
&gt; so much for your help and the second chance on our lab.  
</font>

I think the best thing I can tell you is to check the web site.
All the answers to your questions (I hope) are posted there.  
If not, then please let me know, and I will try to answer.

<font color = "blue">
&gt; I hope you did not already answers these questions in class and 
&gt; I just missed them.
</font>

If I answered these questions in class, how would have missed them?
...unless, of course, you are not coming to class.

<font color = "blue">
&gt; Thank you,
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;&lt;name withheld to protect the student eager to submit Lab 1 for regrade&gt;&gt;
</font>

Good luck with the regrade submission.  Hope you get 100%.
