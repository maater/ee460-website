Several of you have asked if we can do a linux tutorial, since linux
is new to you, or at least that you are very uncomfortable with it.
The short answer is sure.  In fact, if you are planning a career in 
engineering, you really do need to be conversant with linux.  It is 
true that most of the managers and paperwork these days use Windows, 
but engineering tools usually reside on linux.  Employers do get upset
with engineers who show up for their first day of work and have had no
experience using linux.

Class ends at 6:30 on Wednesday.  So, let's take an hour break so you
can get something to eat, do the tutorial at 7:30.  In fact, let's also
schedule a second session on Thursday, from 2 to 3:30.  I should have
the room number for you by the time class meets on Wednesday.

Yale Patt
