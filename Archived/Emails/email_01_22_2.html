For those who wish to attend (completely optional),
the linux special session will be held in ENS 126
tomorrow, Wednesday, from 7:30pm to 8:30pm.

We will also hold a second session on Thursday, 
in RLM 7.116, from 2pm to 3pm.

It would be a good idea to bring your laptop so you
can follow along with the demos.

See you in class tomorrow.

Yale Patt
