As promised, Faruk has set up the mechanism for getting your free pre-test
of lab 1.  You only get one shot at this, so please seriously test the 
program youself before availing yourself of it.  Also, if you are working
with a partner on the lab, the both of you only get one free test.

Instructions are located here:

Good luck finishing Lab 1 on time.

Yale Patt
