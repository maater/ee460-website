A student writes: 

<font color = "blue">
&gt; Hi Dr. Patt,
&gt;
&gt; I had just finished what I thought would be a good code, and I was thinking
&gt; more along the lines of done, actually. Though, it appears that might not
&gt; be the case from the trail test of my program.
&gt;
&gt; According to my trial test, I think I got a 15?  I have no idea where to
&gt; begin to look for an error that deducts that many points. My program can
&gt; assemble in linux and runs perfectly on command prompt. Do you have any
&gt; advice on where I should begin to look for such a large error?
&gt;
&gt; I have e-mailed Faruk with a similar inquiry, but since he has been
&gt; replying slow lately, I figured I should ask you for a bit of advice as
&gt; well since it is late enough. I probably won't get the chance tomorrow
&gt; night either.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you very much for your time and help,
&gt; &lt;&lt;name withheld to protect the student who forgot the need to run dos2unix&gt;&gt;
</font>
Since the question involved details that my TAs are far better than I at
answering, I asked one of my TAs to look at it.  The TA's response:

"The reason you are seeing this error when trying to assemble your 
toupper.asm on linux is because you wrote toupper.asm on windows, 
and did not run dos2unix on it after moving it to linux. Any file 
you generate on windows, you MUST run dos2unix on."
 
Hopefully, that will defuse at least one problem from the rest of you.
Good luck getting your resubmission in, if that is what you are doing today.

Yale Patt
