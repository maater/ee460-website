A student read my earlier email, and immediately picked up on my phrase
"ALL storage."
<font color="black">
&gt; Dr. Patt,
&gt; 
&gt; In your previous email in response to the student confused about what 
&gt; goes on in a cycle you said the following
&gt;<font color="green">
&gt; &gt; MDR is loaded with data coming from memory (or device register) at 
&gt; &gt; the END of the cycle, as is the case with ALL storage.  Processing 
&gt; &gt; goes on during the cycle, results are latched into registers at the 
&gt; &gt; end of the cycle so as to be available for use in the next cycle</font>
&gt; 
&gt; Does "ALL storage" include stores as well, that is, is data supposed 
&gt; to be stored into memory at the END of the 5th cycle? Thanks
</font>

Actually, when I was writing the email, I was focusing on the data path,
where storage refers to registers made up of flip-flops (think edge-triggered
D flip-flops, for example).  I wanted to emphasize the notion that we load
at the end of the clock cycle and what is loaded is then available for use
at the start of the next cycle.   

Memory is a little trickier, since we don't make memory cells out of 
edge-triggered D flip-flops normally.  But, you can think of the same way.  
That, at the end of the 5th clock cycle (in our case), the memory has been 
loaded and is now available for reading.  Of course the notion is somewhat 
less useful in the case of memory, since before you can read, you are going 
to have to load MAR with the new address, so the idea of the result of 
processing stored at the end of one clock cycle and available for use at 
the start of the next cycle is somewhat vacuous in the case of LC-3b memory.

Good luck finishing the problem set by midnight tonight.

Yale Patt
