&gt; Dear Prof Patt,
&gt;                       I was trying to fill up the microcode table for different 
&gt; LC-3b states. I have a doubt regarding that. What if state of some data path 
&gt; signals do not matter during a particular operation? What state shall we consider 
&gt; them to be? The disabled state? Please let me know.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

Good question.  Most signals do, in fact, matter, but not all as you point out.
First of all, consider all load enable signals.  Either you want the register loaded
or you don't in this state, so all of those matter.  Next, gating the bus.  If you
are using the bus, all the gating signals matter - one must be asserted, and none
of the others.  If you are not using the bus, then the gating signals do not matter.
Probably best to just gate none of them to save energy, but you can feel free to 
gate as many as you wish.  What we are left with is all combinational, - control 
signals to muxes that we are not using, control signals to the alu if we are not 
using it, etc.  For these - any signal that controls a combinational circuit that 
we are not using - you are free to specify any value for the control signal.  
The control signal you select will cause some processing to be done, but since we are
not using that structure, the results produced will never be latched.

OK?

Good luck with the rest of the course.

Yale Patt
