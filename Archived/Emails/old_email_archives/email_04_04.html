Sorry for the very late notification.  I was just told the seminar
will be today at 2pm.  If you are able to work it into your schedule,
it could be worthwhile.

&gt; 
&gt; Date:     Friday, April 1, 2011  **Note different day**
&gt; 
&gt; Time:     2:00 pm   **Note different time**

&gt; ABSTRACT:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; From doubling FLOPs to leading edge branch prediction, from sophisticated
&gt; power management to integrated graphics, Intel's Sandy Bridge
&gt; microarchitecture provides break-through performance in a highly efficient
&gt; package. This talk will discuss many of the primary architectural
&gt; enhancements that contribute to Sandy Bridge's success, including vector
&gt; widening, scalable ring interconnect, turbo boost power budgeting, and more.
&gt;
&gt; Biography:
&gt; 
&gt; Beeman Strong, Senior Performance Architect, Intel Corp
&gt; BSEE, UT-Austin, 1996
&gt; 
&gt; Beeman began his career at Intel in 1996, validating ISA features on
&gt; Willamette (P4). He spent 9 years in validation before moving to the
&gt; architecture team in 2005, to work on SMT and livelock prevention. In 2007,
&gt; Beeman moved to focus on branch prediction, and is currently working on
&gt; enhancements for future generation CPUs.
