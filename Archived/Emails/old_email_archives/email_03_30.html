A student writes:

&gt; Suppose we are in the middle of an Exception Handler. One of the

The Timer Interrupt is an interrupt, it gets sampled like all other
interrupts when it is convenient to do - i.e., at instruction boundaries.
So, if the Timer Interrupt goes off at cycle 300 and an instruction is in
the middle, and for example, finishes in cycle 307, then the Timer Interrupt
will be dealt with after cycle 307.

Also, interrupts interrupt lower priority code that is executing.  It does not
matter whether this code is application code, the kernel of the O/S, or some
exception handler.  If the interrupt is more urgent, it interrupts at the next
instruction boundary, the machine is put into a consistent state, and the PC
is loaded with the starting address of the handler.

I hope this helps.

Good luck finishing the lab on time.
