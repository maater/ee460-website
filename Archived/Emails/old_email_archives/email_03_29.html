It occurs to me that, if you have the time, you might want to attend
the Computer Architecture Seminar on Friday.  Topic is the microarchitecture
of the most recent Intel x86 chip.

&gt; ABSTRACT:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; From doubling FLOPs to leading edge branch prediction, from sophisticated
&gt; power management to integrated graphics, Intel's Sandy Bridge microarchitecture
&gt; provides break-through performance in a highly efficient package. This talk
&gt; will discuss many of the primary architectural enhancements that contribute to
&gt; Sandy Bridge's success, including vector widening, scalable ring interconnect,
&gt; turbo boost power budgeting, and more.
&gt; 
&gt; Biography:
&gt; 
&gt; Beeman Strong, Senior Performance Architect, Intel Corp
&gt; BSEE, UT-Austin, 1996
&gt; 
&gt; Beeman began his career at Intel in 1996, validating ISA features on
&gt; Willamette (P4). He spent 9 years in validation before moving to the
&gt; architecture team in 2005, to work on SMT and livelock prevention. In 2007,
&gt; Beeman moved to focus on branch prediction, and is currently working on
&gt; enhancements for future generation CPUs.
&gt;

&gt; The Computer Architecture Seminar Series is sponsored jointly by the
&gt; Departments of Computer Science and Electrical&amp;  Computer Engineering
&gt; and is supported by a grant from IBM.
