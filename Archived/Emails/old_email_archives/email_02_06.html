My students:

I have received a couple of emails that strongly request an extension to the
lab 1 deadline, based on the university being closed on Friday, which canceled
their discussion section and denied them access to LRC labs the whole day.
 
I certainly agree that not having discussion section on Friday was not a good
thing.  I also note that some of you are still dependent on actually sitting
at one of our Windows machines in the LRC lab.  (We also need to talk about
that, but not today.)

However, the disruption of access was one day - Friday.  And, you had all day
today, and will have all day Sunday to complete the lab.  And, the TAs will
have extra office hours on Sunday.  And, an extension just squeezes everything
we have to do in the future.  A one-day extension means many will cut class
on Monday to finish the lab, but will miss critical stuff for lab 3 and the
midterms and final exam.  A two-day extension just cuts short by too much the
time you can spend on lab 2.

Given all of that, I have decided to keep the deadline of 11:59pm on Sunday.

I also note that this is just one lab, and if you have had trouble getting
started, it is not the end of the world.  There will be plenty of opportunity
to recover and still excel in the course.

Good luck finishing lab 1, hopefully on time.
