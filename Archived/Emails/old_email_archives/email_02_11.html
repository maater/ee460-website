My students in 460N,

In the interests of helping you deal with any computer environment
problems as well as any technical problems on the lab assignment itself,
my TAs have volunteered to provide extra office hours this Sunday, as
follows:

Yuhao:1:30 to 4:00 pm
Faruk:4:00 to 8:00 pm
Milad:9:30 to 11:30 pm

Please work on the lab between now and then so as to be able to take 
advantage of the TAs' time on Sunday.

There will also be an extra discussion section instead of class on Monday,
but please do not leave the lab for then.

As you know, we have a lot to do this semester, and I would like us to not
get slowed down by any lack of familiarity with the computer environment.

Good luck with the rest of the semester.

Yale Patt
