&gt; Hello Dr. Patt,
&gt; 
&gt; I am in the process of testing lab 2. I have one question regarding 
&gt; loads and stores. Are we allowed to make unaligned byte loads and 
&gt; stores? Appendix A makes it clear that LDW and STB must be word aligned 
&gt; but did not make it clear if STW and STB should be.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for your time,

Sorry I am just getting to this.  I am out of town at a conference, and
just now got a chance to log in.

First, in your question, you say "LDW and STB."  I hope you meant LDW and 
STW.  And later in the sentence you said "STW and STB."  I hope you meant
LDB and STB.  If not, please see one of the TAs immediately.

A word in memory is unaligned if it crosses a word boundary.  For example,
locations 12 and 13 are inside a word bounday.  Locations 13 and 14 are not.
A simple test for word boundaries: Do address bits other than the low order
bit change between the two addresses.

	12   00001100		13   00001101
	13   00001101           14   00001110
	     -                       ^
	       No			  Yes

A word in aligned memory consists of the bytes at addresses A and A+1, where
A is an even number.  We will see why that is important when we talk about 
physical memory next week.

As to the notion of unalighed byte loads and stores, there is no such thing in
a byte-addressable memory.  Bytes can be stored or loaded from any location 
without any problem.  We will see why next week when we study physical memory. 

Good luck finishing the assignment.

Yale Patt
