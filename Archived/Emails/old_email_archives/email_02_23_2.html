A student writes:

&gt; Dear Prof Patt,
&gt;
&gt; While doing Lab3, I was confused regarding about the use of MARMUX.
&gt; I thought that the MUX should only supply data to the MAR &amp; hence the name. 
&gt; But I found it necessary to use it for something else, that is, it is used 
&gt; for other purposes as well.  So I was wondering if there is a specific 
&gt; reason for labeling that as MARMUX.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your time.

Actually, the main purpose of MARMUX is to supply data via the bus to
the MAR.  Hence its name.  However, this does not mean we can't use any
structure in the data path for whatever useful purpose we come up with,
as you cleverly discovered as you specified the control signals for the
LC-3b.

This is not really all that unusual.  My favorite example is William Perry,
a defensive lineman for the 1980s Chicago Bears.  When the Bears were on
the 1 foot line, they would bring in William Perry, hand him the ball and
he would score.  He was still a defensive lineman.

Or, perhaps you prefer this example.  Did you ever cook up some oatmeal and
eat it right out of the pot so you did not have to wash an extra bowl?  If
yes, would you call it a "pot" or a "pot-bowl."  Most of us would still call
it a pot, even though we were using it as a bowl.

Why am I sending this to the whole class?  ...in addition to providing a little
comic relief.  The data path has a lot of structures that are all available
for your clever use.  Don't be dissuaded from using one of the structures
for an unintended purpose if it allows you to get the job done.  Microarchitects
have been doing that for decades.

Good luck finishing the lab by Sunday night.
