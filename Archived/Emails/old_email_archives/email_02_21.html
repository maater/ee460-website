&gt; Dear Prof Patt,
&gt; I had a conceptual question regarding one Data-path operation . In state 23  
&gt; of the LC-3b, (STW instruction, does  MDR &lt;- SR)  we use the ALU in the PASSA 
&gt; mode, &amp; have also  set appropriate values to the SR1MUX. Is my understanding 
&gt; correct? Please let me know.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; &lt;&lt;name withheld to protect the student with a conceptual question&gt;&gt;

Your understanding is correct.  STW takes a word that is in a register 
and stores it to memory.  To write to memory, one needs to first load MDR
with the stuff to be written and load MAR with the address of where it is
to be written and then hit go (actually, MIO.EN/YES).

Good luck finishing the lab by Sunday night.

Yale Patt
