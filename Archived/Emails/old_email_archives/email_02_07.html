&gt; Professor Patt,
&gt; 
&gt; If a line has too many operands, can we safely ignore 
&gt; them or should we check for extra operands and exit with error code 4?

Sorry I am getting back to you too late to do any good re: lab 1.  However,
since you may see this again on an exam, I thought I would answer your question.

You know that each assembly language instruction occupies a line, so the 
assembly language instruction ends with a line feed.  If there is a ";", 
then everything after the semi-colon is a comment and is ignored, since it
does not contribute to the machine language instruction being generated. 

If there is a label, it is used to create a symbol table entry in the first 
pass, and ignored in the second pass. 

In the second pass, you are left with what should be an opcode and a number of
operands.  If that number is not the correct number for that opcode, then you
have an error.

In the case you mention, for example:  ADD R0,R1,R2,R3 ; comment

The assembler does not stop when it gets its third operand R2.  It continues
to scan until it hits a ";" or a linefeed.  When it sees R3, it knows it has
an incorrectly formed instruction so it exits with error code 4.

Hope you got the assignment in on time.

Good luck with the rest of the course.

Yale Patt
