&gt; Dear Dr. Patt:
&gt; 
&gt; On prob8 of PS2, are we given multiple ALU (or execution units) 
&gt; and can we also assume parallel store(multiple bus)?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; &lt;&lt;name withheld to protect the student who missed a subtlety&gt;&gt;

I realize that this question and answer is coming a little late to do much good
vis-a-vis the problem set due today.  I am responding anyway since the concept is
important and you may see it again on an exam.

Now then, the problem.  I am assuming that by prob8 you really mean problem 9 and 
that you are looking at an old copy of the problem set.  What you see as problem 8 
on the old copy is problem 9 on the current version on the website.

The problem in question pretty clearly states that the processor is an
in-order machine, which means that in any one cycle, at most one instruction can
initiate an ALU operation.  Also, the problem states that the ALU is fully pipelined,
which means that successive ALU operations can be initiated in successive cycles.  
Ergo, the subtlety.  And, the answer is, due to the above two notions, one ALU is 
sufficient.

Good luck with the rest of the course.

Yale Patt
