I was just made aware of the fact that Lab 5 is due just before midnight on
Easter Sunday.  When possible, I prefer to not put students with religious
commitments at a disadvantage.  Ergo, I am changing the due date for lab 5
to Tuesday, April 26th. 

Also, I am told many of you want a review session for the next exam.  For
other religious reasons (Passover), Monday is not a good night.  So, I will
have the review session this Sunday at 6pm.  The room has not yet been
reserved.  When we have a room, we will post it on the class web page.
