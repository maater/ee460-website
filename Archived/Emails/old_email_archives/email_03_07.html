&gt; Dr. Patt,
&gt; 
&gt; I was hoping that you could clarify my doubt about question number 2 
&gt; in the problem set.
&gt; 
&gt; What confuses me is that the question mentions:
&gt; 	"The elements of the 2-dimensional array, A, are 4-bytes in length 
&gt;       and are stored in the memory in column-major order (i.e., columns of A 
&gt;       are stored in consecutive memory locations)"
&gt; 
&gt; Although, in the diagram, A[0][0] is stored in location 0, and A[0][1] is 
&gt; stored in location 32. It is A[1][0] that is stored in location 4, which from 
&gt; what I understand is the next location (address) after location 0 (but which is 
&gt; not physically the 'next' location). So then...
&gt; 
&gt; Please could you clarify for me what is meant by a "consecutive location". Is it:
&gt; A) Physically close locations (from the perspective of same bank etc...) OR
&gt; B) locations that come one after the other from an address point of view, 
&gt; regardless of actual on-chip physical location, i.e. consecutive address.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; &lt;&lt;name withheld to protect the student who wants to know the meaning of "next"&gt;&gt;

The notions of row-major and column-major are from the standpoint of the person 
writing the algorithm and/or program, and not designing the hardware.

So, I ask you a question: What does the person writing the progam know about the
organization of the memory chips?  Usually: nothing.  At the level of the algorithm
and the program, the two-dimensional array is an abstract concept.  Elements need 
to be stored in some particular sequential order, since memory is sequentally 
addressed.  Column-major order dictates that the address of A[1,0] should be the 
next sequential address after A[0,0].  Whether those two data elements are actually
physically next to each other in memory depends on how the memory chips are actually 
organized by the hardware designer/computer architect..

Bottom line: to the algorithm designer, column-major order simply means the addresses
of A[1,0] and A[0.0] are adjacent.  The hardware designer is free to select address 
bits for each structure in memory according to what appears to him/her to be optimal
from the standpoint of processing.

OK?

Good luck on the exam on Wednesday.
