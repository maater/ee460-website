&gt; Prof. Patt,
&gt; 
&gt; Could you let me know when the late submission for lab 4 will be opened?
&gt; just for testing? I just tried but it is not working now. I got messed up
&gt; on a few the control store bits when trying to modifying states last night
&gt; and get pretty frustrated. Continuous correcting  made it seem to be
&gt; working this morning. But I'm really eager to get my program tested again
&gt; so that I will be confident with my design and understanding on
&gt; interruption/exception, though the score is so poor....
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; &lt;&lt;name withheld to protect the student who wants to understand intrpts/exc&gt;&gt;

The site will be opened later tonight so you can continue to use it for
testing.  However, please use your time carefully.  You have a midterm 
coming up next week.  Most of your focus should be on your problem set
and understanding the material for the exam.

Good luck on the exam next week.

Yale Patt
