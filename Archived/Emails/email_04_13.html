I just wanted to let you know: My TAs tell me that there are still a lot of
questions about cache memory and asynchronous buses, so I have decided to not
move on to multi-thread parallelism on Monday, but instead review during class
some of the concepts we have already discussed.  Caches and asynchronous buses
are first on my list.

Apparently, most of you would like a review session Monday evening, so we
will have one, beginning at 7pm.  We should know the room number by the time
class starts.

Good luck on the second midterm.

Yale Patt
