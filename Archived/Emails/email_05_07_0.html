&gt; Dr. Patt,
&gt; I brought this up in Stephen's session on Friday, but hadn't heard anything
&gt; so I thought I'd go ahead and ask you. Are you going to host a review
&gt; session for the final exam sometime this week? I know many of us would
&gt; really like to have one. Tomorrow would probably be best since exams begin
&gt; on Wednesday.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

The university does not allow us to hold formal review sessions during the
final exam period.  And, even if they did, we do not have enough lead time 
to do so Tuesday night.  In addition, I can not do it Wednesday.  However, 
Faruk has agreed to hold office hours in a classroom on Wednesday around 5pm 
so students can listen to other students' questions and Faruk's answers.  We
will try to find an available room and post it on the class web site on
Tuesday.

If Wednesday at 5pm is not good for you, please let me know and I will see
about providing extra office hours.

Yale Patt
