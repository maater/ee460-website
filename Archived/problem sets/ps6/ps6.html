<p>These questions are to aid you in your studies. They are not to be turned in
and they do not cover all the topics covered in class after Problem Set 5.</p>

<ol>

<li><!-- Begin Question -->
<p>Using a residue number system with two moduli, represent all of the decimal
values between 0 and 11 inclusive when the moduli are</p>
<ol type="a">
  <p>
  <li>4 and 3</li>
  <li>6 and 2</li>
  </p>
</ol>
</li><!-- End of Question -->

<li><!-- Begin Question -->
<p>Consider the following example used to explain Tomasulo's Algorithm:</p>
<pre><code>
Format: Opcode Destination Source1 Source2
MUL R3,  R1, R2
ADD R5,  R3, R4
ADD R7,  R2, R6
ADD R10, R8, R9
MUL R11, R7, R10
ADD R5,  R5, R11
MUL R10, R4, R10
</pre></code>
<p>Construct the Data Flow Graph for this program.</p>
</li><!-- End of Question -->

<li><!-- Begin Question -->
<p>Consider the following format for transmitting a byte of data using the ECC
mechanism described in class (Hamming Code).</p>
<pre><code>
D7 D6 D5 D4 P8 D3 D2 D1 P4 D0 P2 P1
</code></pre>
<p>For the following bit pattern, indicate whether there is no error or a
single error. If there is a single error, list the corrected bit pattern.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>110010010111</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In general, what happens when there are two bit errors with this mechanism?</p>
</li><!-- End of Question -->

<li><!-- Begin Question -->
<p>Using the Booth Multiplication Algorithm, multiply the two unsigned 10-bit
numbers 0011011110 and 0001110010. Show the intermediate results after each
step.</p>
</li><!-- End of Question -->

<li><!-- Begin Question -->
<p>From Tanenbaum, 4th edition, Appendix B, 4.</p>

<p>The following binary floating-point number consists of a sign bit, an excess
63, radix 2 exponent, and a 16-bit fraction.  Express the value of this number
as a decimal number.</p>

<p><tt>0 0111111 0000001111111111</tt></p>
</li><!-- End of Question -->

<li><!-- Begin Question -->
<p>From Tanenbaum, 4th edition, Appendix B, 5.</p>

<p>To add two floating point numbers, you must adjust the exponents (by
shifting the fraction) to make them the same. Then you can add the fractions
and normalize the result, if need be. Add the single precision IEEE
floating-point numbers 3EE00000H and 3D800000H and express the normalized
result in hexadecimal. ['H' is a notation indicating these numbers are in
hexadecimal]</p>

<li><!-- Begin Question -->
<p>From Tanenbaum, 4th edition, Appendix B, 6.</p>

<p>The Tightwad Computer Company has decided to come out with a machine having
16-bit floating-point numbers. The model 0.001 has a floating-point format with
a sign bit, 7-bit, excess 63 exponent and 8-bit fraction. Model 0.002 has a
sign bit, 5-bit, excess 15 exponent and a 10-bit fraction. Both use radix 2
exponentiation. What are the smallest and largest positive normalized numbers
on both models? About how many decimal digits of precision does each have?
Would you buy either one?</p>
</li><!-- End of Question -->

<li><!-- Begin Question -->
<p>The following numbers are represented exactly 
with a 9-bit floating point representation, in the format of the IEEE 
Floating Point standard:</p>

<p>-infinity, -1, 0, 5/16, 19.5, 48.</p>

<ol type="a">
<p>
<li>How many bits are needed for the fraction?</li>
<li>What is the bias?</li>
<li>Write each number in in the 9-bit floating point representation,
below:

<table border=1>
<tr> <td>Value      </td><td> Representation </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>48         </td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>19.5       </td><td>&nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>5/16       </td><td>&nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>0          </td><td>&nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>-1         </td><td>&nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>-infinity </td><td>&nbsp; </td> </tr>

<li><!-- Begin Question -->
<p>We must compute the following expression:</p>
<pre>
    a*x^6 + b*x^5 + c*x^4 + d*x^3 + e*x^2 + f*x + g 
</pre>
<ul>
  <li>How many operations and time-steps will the computation take on a single
  processor system (Use the smallest number of operations possible)?</li>
  <li>How many operations and time-steps will the computation take on a
  multiprocessor system with 4 processors? (Use the smallest number of
  operations possible)</li>
  <li>What is the speedup of the multiprocessor system over a single
  processor?</li>

<li><!-- Begin Question -->
<p>In an Omega network as presented in class, assume that there are n inputs
and n outputs. Let k be the size of each switch. For k taking the values 2, 4,
8, and 64, answer the following questions. (Assume the cost of each switch is
k^2)</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>What is the cost of the network as a function of n?</li>
  <li>What is the latency of the network?</li>
  <li>Assume that n=64. What k value would you choose? Why? State your
