 EE 360N, Spring 2007<br />
 Problem Set 1b <br />
 Due: before class January 31st, 2007<br />
 Yale N. Patt, Instructor<br />
 Chang Joo Lee, Rustam Miftakhutdinov, Poorna Samanta, TAs <br />
 
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>You are encouraged to work on the problem set in groups and turn in one problem
set for the entire group. Remember to put all your names on the solution
sheet. Also remember to put the name of the TA in whose discussion section
you would like the problem set turned back to you.</p>
<p><em>You will need to refer to the assembly language handouts and the LC-3b ISA on the course website.</em></p>

<h2>Questions</h2>
<ol class="questions">
<li><p>Consider the following LC-3b assembly language program:</p>
<pre><code>        .ORIG x3000
	AND R5, R5, #0
	AND R3, R3, #0
	ADD R3, R3, #8
	LEA R0, B
	LDW R1, R0, #1
	LDW R1, R1, #0
	ADD R2, R1, #0
AGAIN	ADD R2, R2, R2
	ADD R3, R3, #-1
	BRp AGAIN
	LDW R4, R0, #0
	AND R1, R1, R4
	NOT R1, R1
	ADD R1, R1, #1
	ADD R2, R2, R1
	BRnp NO
	ADD R5, R5, #1
NO	HALT
B	.FILL XFF00
A	.FILL X4000
	.END</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The assembler creates a symbol table after the first pass. Show
the contents of this symbol table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does this program do? (in less than 25 words)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the programmer wrote this program, he/she did not take full
advantage of the instructions provided by the LC-3b ISA. Therefore the program
executes too many unnecessary instructions. Show what the programmer should
have done to reduce the number of instructions executed by this program.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the following LC-3b assembly language
program.</p>
<pre><code>        .ORIG	x4000
MAIN	LEA	R2,L0
	JSRR	R2
	JSR	L1
	HALT
	;
L0	ADD	R0,R0,#5
	RET
	;
L1	ADD	R1,R1,#5
	RET</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Assemble the above program. Show the LC-3b machine code for each instruction in the program as a hexadecimal number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This program shows two ways to call a subroutine. One requires two instructions:
<code>LEA</code> and <code>JSRR</code>. The second requires only one instruction: <code>JSR</code>. Both ways work
correctly in this example. Is it ever necessary to use <code>JSRR</code>? If so, in what
situation?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please go to the handouts section of the course web site, print and fill out the student information sheet, and turn it in with a recognizable recent photo of yourself on January 31st (the same day this problem set is due).</p>
</li>
</ol>
