<p>A bit-serial transmitter-receiver system operates at 1 GHz. It appends an even parity bit after every eight bits processed, as described in class. Therefore, for each byte of data, it transmits a nine bit message. Since the system is bit-serial, one message bit is transmitted each cycle. Assume that the probability of a bit being flipped while it is being transmitted is 10<sup>-7</sup>. In your solution, treat bit flips as statistically independent events.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What is the probability that a transmitted nine bit message will have one <em>or more</em> flipped bits? Hint: what is the probability that a transmitted nine bit message will have <em>zero</em> flipped bits?</p></li>
<li><p>If the parity check logic in the receiver detects an error in a message, how many bits may have been flipped in that message? (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 &ndash; circle all that apply).</p></li>
<li><p>If the parity check logic in the receiver <em>does not</em> detect an error in a message, how many bits may have been flipped in that message? (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 &ndash; circle all that apply).</p></li>
<li><p>What is the probability that a transmitted nine bit message will have exactly:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 bit flipped</li>
<li>2 bits flipped</li>
<li>3 bits flipped</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that the probability of exactly three bits being flipped is negligible compared to the probabilities of one or two bits being flipped. Thus, for the rest of this problem, you may neglect the probabilities of three or more bits being flipped in one message.</p>
</li>
<li>On average, how many <em>detected</em> bit errors per second will occur in the system?</li>
<li>On average, how many <em>undetected</em> bit errors per second will occur in the system?</li>
</ol>
